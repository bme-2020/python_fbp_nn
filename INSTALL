** Latest version can be found at http://dmpelt.github.io/pynnfbp/ **

To install PyNN-FBP, simply run:

python setup.py install

To use PyNN-FBP, you need installed:

- Numpy and scipy
- PyTables
- (for ASTRAProjector) The ASTRA toolbox (https://code.google.com/p/astra-toolbox/), with Python interface (https://github.com/dmpelt/pyastratoolbox)
- (for SimplePyCUDAProjector) PyCUDA and pyfft.

Examples can be found in the 'examples' directory. After installation, the examples can be run to show how the package is used.

Running 'PaperExample.py' from the 'examples' directory should show comparable results to the threeshape experiment (Fig. 9a and Table 1) of [1].
